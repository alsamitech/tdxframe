# TDX Framework
# BY SAMI

This is a framework in C++ 
This is intended for developing console applications. All the hard work is done for you so you can focus on what matters.
This also has stdio.h **localized** in `sources/io.h` as this heavily depends on that library to work properly. This library, in total has a few depenends on the C standard libraries and exC in some versions of this library. 

**BASICS OF THE TDX FRAMEWORK**
This contains temporary places to keep numerical values. These are called **All-Acsess Variables (AAVs)** there are multiple types of AAVs including a, b, c, and R. but this is how the first 30 AAVs work (type a & r):
1-10 hold an int value
10-20 hold a double value
20-30 hold a float value

**SOME VESIONS OF THIS RELY ON the exC LIBRARIES**

(The Standard version includes a minitruized version of exC)
