# TDXFRAME PACKAGE INSTALLER

The TDX framwork comes with an installer. The insaller generates a basic file structure for your application which the user can either keep at their desired location or (if on Window) move it to thier `Program Files` folder. Or integrate into thier system if on Linux (Support for MacOS not included yet).

## TDX-FRAME Packages
**TDX Packages** is a direcotry (usually in a zip) that is used to install and integrate applications into the system. These packages can ***easily** be installed manually and don't requre a package manager. TDX Packages contain all dependencies in the package.

## Things to note
**You MUST compile the installer on your own and follow the instructions put in comments at `installer/installer.cpp` This is to make sure everyone's installer is fit for thier application's needs**
